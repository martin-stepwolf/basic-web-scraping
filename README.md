# Basic Web Scraping 

_Website to get data from other website, clean the code and get the most common words._

### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Project developed in a subject when I was student.
As better developer I refactor all the project with my better skills and practices.

### Achievements :star2:

As IT student, I knew already about php and JavaScript, in the subject I achieved:

- Teamwork despite nobody uses git/github.
- Get the data with PHP and process it with JavaScript.

Now with the refactorization I achieved:

- Clean code, HTML semantic and better practices.
- Use regular expressions to clean the data.

### Installing ðŸ”§

The programs you need are:

- PHP 7.

Then run the server:

```
